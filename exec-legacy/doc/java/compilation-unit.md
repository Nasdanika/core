Specialization of File.


Configured with the following keys:

* ``contents`` - a content component, a string, or a list of content components.
* ``format`` - boolean. If true (default) the compilation unit is auto-formatted.
* ``imports`` - fully qualified names of classes to add to the imports section. A string or a list of strings. Optional.
* ``merger`` - ${javadoc/org.nasdanika.common.resources.Merger} implementation if ``reconcile-action`` is ``MERGE``. Optional there is a native merger.
* ``name`` - file name, interpolated. ``.java`` extension is optional for compilation units and is added automatically if not present.
* ``reconcile-action`` - defines an action to take if a file with given name already exists. Default action is ``OVERWRITE``:
    * ``KEEP`` - Keep the existing file, discard generated contents.
    * ``APPEND`` - Append generated contents to the existing contents.
    * ``MERGE`` - Merge old and new contents. 
    * ``OVERWRITE`` - Replace the existing contents with the generated contents.
    * ``CANCEL`` -  Cancel generation if a file already exists.
 
Automatically inserts the package declaration at the top of the file.

Adds an import manager to the context so ``${{import/<fully qualified type name>}}`` tokens are replaced with short names where applicable and corresponding import declarations are added to the imports section below the package declaration.

Compilation units provide a native merger which overwrites Java constructs which have a clean/empty ``@generated`` tag in their javadoc comments and preserve Java constructs which don't have such a tag or which is
not empty/dirty, e.g. ``@generated NOT``.

In the code snippet below ``getPropertyDescriptors()`` method would be overwritten during generation because it has a "clean" ``@generated`` Javadoc tag.
``addFormatPropertyDescriptor()`` will not be overwritten because it has a "dirty" ``@generated NOT`` tag.

```java
/**
 * This returns the property descriptors for the adapted class.
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * @generated
 */
@Override
public List<IItemPropertyDescriptor> getPropertyDescriptors(Object object) {
	...
}

/**
 * This adds a property descriptor for the Format feature.
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * @generated NOT
 */
protected void addFormatPropertyDescriptor(Object object) {
	...
}

```
