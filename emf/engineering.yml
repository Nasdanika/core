     - name: Support of mutually exclusive features   
       markdown-description: Annotation exclusive-with - space-separated list of keys.                                    
     - name: EClass descriptor
       description: From annotations. Choices from overriden methods. Use in UI and CLI. May also be constructed from EObject - values, choices from resource set.                         
     - name: load-default annotation
       markdown-description: |+2
         YAML to load if configuration key is not present. E.g. if representations key is not present use a particular representation. 
         In this case to suppress representations just provide an empty list of representations.
         Maybe load-default-yaml and load-default-json.
         This would alow allow to load defaults from external locations using exec-resource, for example.                          
     - name: Computed features (mostly attributes)
       description: |+2
         Some way to indicate that value is computed. 
         If so, wrap value being set into function taking the object as argument (this) and returing computed value.
         Support calling Java and JavaScript.
         Perhaps support for derived values which are not loaded by default - load them and access raw value in getters.
