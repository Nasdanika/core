         YAML to load if configuration key is not present. E.g. if representations key is not present use a particular representation. 
         In this case to suppress representations just provide an empty list of representations.
         Maybe load-default-yaml and load-default-json.
         This would alow allow to load defaults from external locations using exec-resource, for example.
