      name: Artifact inheritance of representation properties from templates
      description: |+2
        Cascading inheritance, merging of properties. Would allow to define a library of artifact templates (building blocks) and assemble composite artifacts from them. 
        E.g. cloud components - storage, compute, cache, networking. Generated diagrams would have styles like images readily available.
