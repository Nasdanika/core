       markdown-description: |+2              
         Add support of [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR). Endeavor contains objectives. 
         Objectives reference Endeavor. E.g. month objectives, quarter objectives, release or feature objectives.
         Objective may contain sub-objectives and may reference parent objective - mutually exclusive - contained objective cannot reference a parent.
         Validations of objectives hierarchy, end of the contained objective endeavor shall be before the end of the containing objective endeavor.
         
         Objectives can contain key results. Both objectives and key results are Aims and endeavors can be aligned to them. Validation that aligned endeavors
         end before the objective endeavor.
         
         Both objective and key result have ``weight`` with default value ``1`` and derived ``completion`` attributes. 
         Completion for key results is computed as weighted completion of aligned endeavors. Maybe add weight to Alignment with default 1 and do not take total effort into
         account. If there is a mix of sub-objectives and key results and alignments they are all objective contributors with weights. 
         On the objective page show 3 tables - sub-objectives (children), key results, alignments.  
          
         ### Old notes 
          
         Objectives can be nested and can reference a parent objective, e.g. Engineer's containing organization objective. Nested objective can't have parent reference.
         Objectives can reference increments. E.g. 2021 Q3 objective.
         Objectives may contain key results. Objectives and key results may have weight which determines how much they contribute to container/parent.
         Objectives may contain issues. Issues may contribute either to objectives directly or to key results. Benefit may be used as issue weight or additional attribute.
         Maybe EngineeredCapability shall be contributing, so release or feature may contribute.
         Contribution class with weight and target. Default weight is 1, target is the default feature. 
         Aim is a base class for Objective and Key Result. Concrete - for proxying.
         Ability to manually set progress in aims - value between 0 and 1. This value will be added to the value of contributions.
         Contributions count in aim progress only when they are available - done, released, ... 
         Although effort/cost based progress may also be computed.  
         Maybe an objective shall be able to contribute to key results and thus instead of parent link it shall have that contirbutes reference.
         I.e. Contributions are done to Aim by Contributors - Objectives, Key results, EngineeredCapabilities. Contained aims have weight attribute which means their contribution to the container.  
         Objectives may have benefit and that benefit may be used to compute effective benefit for contributors based on their weight. 
         Objectives being contributors themselves also have effectiveBenefit. As such it should be possible to define benefits only for top-level objectives and compute
         effective benefits down to issues. As "leaf" benefits are likely to be very small numbers they may be normalized to 1 for the largest benefit and also ranked. 
         Issues can be sorted in the order of decreasing effective benefit. 
     - name: Notes from Git commit history
       markdown-description: |+2
         Flag to enable - true by default.
         Look for a YAML block in commit comments, e.g. something starting with --- Engineering --- and ending with --- End Engineering ---
         Parse as YAML - issue key with issue URI. Also time spent and remaining effort. Engineer - find by committer e-mail or explicitly specify.
         As part of it or before it (in 2021.5.0) - add support of referencing engineers by e-mail - AbstractGenerateSiteConsumerFactory getURI() to getURIs() or boolean matchURI().
         Engineering block does not go to the note description. Decide how to treat commit contents - markdown by default and a flag to overrie to treat as plain text?

     - name: Metrics/Measurements
       markdown-description: |+2
         Metrics are defined at engineer, engineered element, or just model element. Measurements are collected under Observations.
         Obeservation may have more than one measurement. Observation is a period. It may have a description, e.g. comments - extends ModelElement.
         Measurement references Metric. Observation may have a status, e.g. planned, completed.
         allObservations derived reference - uses ObservationProvider context service - passes self and gets a list of external observations back. 
         E.g. a number of downloads for a release, or a number of site visits, or user rating. There might be multiple types of measurements. Metric may specify measurement type and validate. 
         E.g. DoubleMetric with a single double value or multi-double value to compute avarage, deviation, etc.
         Or AggregatedDoubleMetric which already has avarage, min, max, etc. computed.  
     - name: Activity duration/cost

     - name: Activity steps
       markdown-description: |+2
         Section actions, paragraphs. Engineered elements. URL with fragment. The goal is to allow maintaining issue and owners at a step level as well as discussion forums. 
         Also allow to maintain steps in their own files.
         Leverage list of contents. Steps can be nested.
     - name: Generated org charts
       markdown-description: |+2
         Visualization of org structure. Configurable number of levels up and down. People-based or org based or combined - org name and head (owner) in parenthesis with individually linking to the org and the owner.
         Option to specify whether to show individual engineers or just organizations. An option to show headcount - title with token expansion - ``name``, ``owner``, ``head-count``, ``total-head-count``. For leaf orgs at the bottom show total headcount.
         Auto depth based on the total number of orgs to be shown, e.g. specify that max-shapes is 10 then no more than 10 orgs will be shown. For leaf orgs use a visual differentiator, e.g. a different border to show that there is more.
         Engineers are boxless nodes? Support of multiple visualizations - many containment reference org-charts - homogenous, strict containment.
     - name: Engineer reference/proxy

         Support of issues tracked elsewhere. Solve at the resource loading level by using specialized resource factories. Top-down and bottom-up approaches.         
     - name: Configurable representations (diagrams)
       markdown-description: |+2
         Issues and other model elements have representation reference and different representations, which can be model-element specific. E.g. Gantt, WBS, or state diagram for issues and WBS (org chart) for organizations.
         Representations are rendered as section actions. Composite representation - style - cards, pills, ... Cards columns. Charts can be introduced this way.           
     - name: Journey element input artifacts (requirements) and output artifacts (deliverables)
       markdown-description: Infer transition artifacts from journey element artirfacts and vice-versa, validations of consistency, e.g. an output transition lists an artifact which is not in the list of journey element deliverables.
     - name: Capacity, allocation, utilization calculation and validation
       markdown-description: |+2
         Total of increment issues does not exceed allocation if it is present. If an issue is worked over multiple increments use issue start/end to pro-rate. 
         Total of allocations does not exceed capacity.
         Utilization, two levels - a) engineer capacity is allocated b) allocations are utilized by assigning issues. Configurable validations and under/over allocation margins - context service?
         For allocation compute utilization from issue notes. For capacity from allocations. Capacity shall be allocated, allocations shall be assigned. Then utilization is tracked - burn down how much of allocated is used.
     - name: Aims, principles, alignments
       markdown-description: |+2
         Aim is a a concrete base class for Objective, KeyResult, Persona Goal, and Principle. Principle is hierarchical. Steal principle definition from TOGAF. 
         Endeavor has alignment homogenous strict containment reference. Alignment is a model element referencing Aim. allAlignments derived reference.
         Aim has derived opposite reference - alignements. Principle containment homogenous reference under EngineeredElement - e.g. architecture principles for an organization, design/coding principles for a component.
         Consider ``extends`` relationship between principles. E.g. module level principle extends a more generic organization level principle. Many-to-many relationship.   
     - name: YAML spec examples
       markdown-description: Add to documentation.             
     - name: Documents and sections
       markdown-description: |+2
         Engineered elements, partial support of action configuration - section style, section role - e.g. a section can be shown as context action or on the content panels - left or right. Category support too. Content is displayed in the first nav, inherited info in the second. 
         Other options are dialog, collapsible, and context action which calls super.doGenerate() - do not cache. Add support of resources and directories in the UI where to keep documents. 
         Document extends section. Table of contents configuration (not component) - location (e.g. right navigation), style - list/table, title (optional), depth.              
     - name: Extract ModelElement, NamedElement, Appearance, ... to a common model
       markdown-description: |+2
         Including ViewAction classes. Also Document, Section, Reference, Link.  
         The model should be a part of Core and Gen classes part of HTML. Would allow to relatively quickly build new models on top. 
         Also extract activities, journeys (rename to flows as more generic) into a common model.
         Consider dropping existing NCore and replace with with this new one. Keep original concrete classes in the engineering model as
         sub-classes of the extracted classes for future extensibility and model spec compatibility.                
     - name: Parent reference to Engineer
       markdown-description: |+2
         For bottom-up linking during generation of federated sites. Similar to bottom-up linking in Eclipse documentation.                
     - name: Appearance icon and description
       markdown-description: |+2
         Implement support for icon and descriptions. Also section-style.                  
     - name: Appearance view-action
       markdown-description: |+2
         ``viewAction``/``view-action`` - FQN of a class or static method which creates ViewAction's for model elements and features.
         Static method name is separated from class name with ``::`` as in method references. Adapter factory takes appearance into account and for features ModelElementViewAction first
         checks appearance before calling featureActions - i.e. customizations trump overrides. For features the factory method may return an array or a collection or an iterable or a stream.
         For model elements method/constructor takes 2 arguments - target and factory. For features - also two arguments - semantic element view action and feature.
         Document in appearance--view-action.md with examples. Consider an option with "Call" class as in org.nasdanika.exec.Call - class name is a default feature and then method, init, etc.
         Maybe as an improvement - start just with class name and method name and ``::`` as a shortcut for specifying class and method name as one string.                  
     - name: Persona avatar
       markdown-description: |+2
         Image URL or a class with URL being a default property and an option so specify height and width. Display in the properties table.                  
     - name: Reference and Link
       markdown-description: |+2
         Named elements. Reference points to a model element in the resource set by URI. URI is the default feature. Name, description are "inherited" from the target if not set explicitly.
         Referrers derived opposite reference to NamedElement.
         Link points to URL, which is also a default property.                   
     - name: Profiles
       markdown-description: |+2
         Nested. Contain context properties and appearance. Properties and apperance are inherited by child profiles.
         Generation - utility methods to generate for a profile. Profiles reference to model element - included/excluded. A way to support multiple stakeholder views.                    
     - name: ModelElement digest and forum subscriptions
       markdown-description: |+2
         Introduce digest operation or derived attribute. Computed from non-derived set features by computing feature value digest and then creating a YAML map of feature name -> feature digest and doing SHA-256 to compute object digest.
         For references - feature element digest is simply URI of the target.
         Subscriptions at forum level - this way it would be possible to subscribe for engineered elements too. Subscription features - subscriber (engineer), frequency - daily, weekly, ..., whether it is recursive, 
         maybe filter(s) in MongoDB way - RegEx if string, feature name to RegEx or match spec if map. Generation process or another process loads the model and then tree-iterates via subscriptions and sends notifications to 
         the notification service. The service is responsible for keeping history of last time notifications and notify only if time period has passed and digest changed.                       
     - name: Appearance - features to show in tables
     - name: ModelElement tags
       markdown-description: |+2
         Property class - value (multi-string, default feature), description and markdown description. PropertyEntry class - String key, Property value.
         EMap tags at ModelElement level. Possible use - aliasing. Maybe name ``properties`` and use wider, e.g. to customize behavior.
         Render as a table in a feature action.                       
     - name: Icons
       markdown-description: |+2
         Icons for all or most model elements. Perhaps buy from Icons8 or Shutterstock (~$10 per icon) or Iconfinder ($2-3 per icon) or some other service.                       
     - name: Appearance - feature order
       markdown-description: |+2
         Ability to specify feature order. E.g. that increments are shown after modules.                       
     - name: Decision
       markdown-description: |+2
         Extends Aim and EngineeredElement. Effective dates - start, end. I.e. it takes effort to make a decision, it can be made in a series of endeavors, e.g. conducting POC's. 
         It is owned by an engineer and may have experts. It may be aligned to other aims. And other aims and endeavors can be aligned to the decision.
         Later on - multi-criteria decisions with criteria and alternatives and other things.
         Extends capability too - issues and other decisions can require it - decision chaining. Resolution and markdown resolution attributes in addition to description.
         Decision may be considered to be an endeavor. If decided so - update endeavor descripton. Decision is an engineered capability, but can't extend it because it would inherit ``aligns`` from both engineered capability and aim.
         Validation of decision effective dates - derived decision effective dates shall be within effective dates of decisions it is based on.
         Decision shall also have status - simply reuse issue status? Would need rejected and superceded statuses in this case.
         Or decision is a special case of issue? If so, introduce "Alignable" class with both Aim and EngineeredCapability extending it. This way decision is an issue which extends Aim.  
         Make Endeavor alignable instead of Engineered capability? E.g. a quarter can be aligned to addressing technical debt. 
         Superceded and supercedes references. The superceding decision references the superceded. Superceded reference is derived. Many to many - one decision may supercede multiple and a decision may be superceded by several decisions.
         Even if one of them is rejected the superceded decision is still superceded if any of superceding is effective - done and within the effective dates range.
         Premises/Entailments reference (not needed - requires/requiredBy will do). Entailments is a derived reference.                        
     - name: Visualizations of aims and alignments
       markdown-description: Including decision chains.
     - name: ModelElement sections, TOC depth, role, and style
       markdown-description: |+2
         Move sections from Document to ModelElement. Re-introduce TableOfContents class with ``depth`` default property with value -1 (unlimited).
         ``table-of-contents`` homogenous strict containment reference in ModelElement. Additional attributes - role and style - map (properties).
         E.g. to be able to specify ``max-width`` in case of a floating card.
     - name: Style to Appearance
       markdown-description: |+2
         Contemplate adding style map to Appearance. How would it be applied? If present, wrap whatever is returned from generate into a DIV and then cascade from all styles - model element, containment feature, lineage?
     - name: Absolute URL's in path AS-IS
       markdown-description: |+2
         Recognize absolute URL's/URI's (those starting with schema) in path and use AS-IS. For activator - also use AS-IS, i.e. do not use containment path, but relativize.
         Needed for site federation - ability to create "proxy" model elements. E.g. an organization would create proxies for its departments and departments would create
         proxies for sub-departments and may also create a proxy for the root action - in this case there would be no need in the root action - it can be null.  
     - name: Resource uploading during generation
       markdown-description: |+2
         Duplicate, just to make sure - ``resource`` token replacer if there is ResourceManager service - takes URI of the resource relative to the YAML spec, uploads it somewhere (or writes to the output directory)
         and returns a URL relative to the generated page.
     - name: Conditional appearance
       markdown-description: |+2
         Extends Apperance and has condition attribute which is JavaScript evaluated with the semantic element available in binding as well as context.
         Appearance has a containment reference of conditional appearances - kinda cascading styles. Matched top-down - if parent matches then children are evaluated.
         Applied bottom-up first match. E.g. the first match which has icon key would define the icon. Values can contain interpolation tokens, e.g. issue icon can be taken from its status icon.
     - name: Contact methods, notifications of validations and escalations.
       markdown-description: |+2
         Introduce contact methods from Party. Also, introduce a notification interface - something with boolean notify(Notification) - to adapt contact methods to in 
         order to send notifications. For e-mails the notification will be converted to a JavaMail message, a session of whatever service will be obtained from the context,
         and the message will be sent. For escalations - a week (should be configurable) before endeavor becomes an overdue - notification the assignee, Info status,
         when it becomes an overdue - notification to the assignee and the owner of the containing engineer and the engineer itself - warning. A week later - error and also to the next level of the hierarchy.
         Escalate to the next level every week. Can be done by something like a Jenkins or CircleCI scheduled jobs. Aggregate and group by severity.
     - name: Relative dates
       markdown-description: E.g. ``${start} + 2 weeks``. Usable for templates. Look at how https://plantuml.com/gantt-diagram does it. 
     - name: Issue severity and priority
       markdown-description: |+2
         Document the difference, add to tables. Appearance - feature section with a summary table. 
         Think about some approach to control that say a codebase with show-stopper severity issues cannot be merged to some branches - e.g. it should stay in ``develop``.
         Provide a mapping of issue severity URI's to diagnostic statuses - context service - if such mapping is found, validation of an not done issue in that severity would result in a diagnostic with
         respective severity. E.g. show-stopper to ERROR in ``develop`` and to FAIL in ``master``, i.e. site generation would fail in ``master`` if there are showstoppers.    
     - name: Key results initiatives
       markdown-description: |+2
         Containment reference for issues. Take into account in completion calculations. Another way to track execution.
         Include in allIssues. Show on the key result page. Appearance - element-actions/none, ...           
     - name: Extend feature things to TypedElement to support operations
       markdown-description: |+2
         Operation apperance similar to feature appearance, ViewActions which invoke operations. featureIcon, label, ... How to handle operations in appearance.
         Another option is a parallel structure with OPERATION_ROLE etc. - a bit of duplication, but should not break existing stuff...
     - name: Document inheritance
       markdown-description: |+2
         Document.extends reference to another document. ModelElement.allSections derived reference returns sections by defult.

         So releases, features, and increments may have engineers tracking/driving execution/delivery. Rework the assignments section in Engineer to have sub-sections - increments, releases, features, issues.
         Hide endeavors with zero total cost (e.g. incrments without scheduled releases or issues), and completed. To documentation - composite effort assignees are responsible for tracking and escalation/removal of obstacles,
         e.g. increment assignee is kinda scrum master and release/feature assignee is kinda project manager.
