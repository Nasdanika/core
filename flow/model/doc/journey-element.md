[Journey](Journey.html) element is a source and target of [transitions](Transition.html) and [calls](Call.html).

It can specify [personas](../Persona.html), e.g. personas partaking into an [activity](Activity.html) or personas using a [service](Service.html).

Journey elements can override or suppress elements with the same path defined in one of journeys the containing journey extends. 

Journey element may also specify what they shall receive from input transitions or calls - requirement, and what they shall pass to output transitions - deliverables.
