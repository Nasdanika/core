Activity is an element of a [Journey](Journey.html). 
Activities can be used to describe:

* [Persona](../Persona.html) journeys in terms of [features](../Feature.html) provided by [products](../Product.html).
* How a product can be used.
* Services offered by [engineers](Engineer.html).

Because journey is a sub-type of activity a service offered by an engineer may be documented as a journey which references product features and services offered by other engineers.
And persona journeys can also include both self-service activities, which use features, and "service" activities where the persona interacts with engineers.
