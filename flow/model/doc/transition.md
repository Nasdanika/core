Transition connects two [journey](Journey.html) elements, e.g. [activities](Activity.html) and is navigated when execution of the source element is completed
and execution of the target element shall begin. 

Transition may define payload - what the source shall pass along the transition to the element. 
For example, a transition from "Business Analysis" to "Design" may have "Requirements Document" as its payload.
