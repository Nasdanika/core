Service is a reference to a shared [activity](Activity.html) used in multiple [flows](Flow.html).
For example, a [service provider](ServiceProvider.html), e.g. a [participant](Participant.html) may define a service activity or flow and that service activity/flow
may be referenced from service flow defined by other participant journeys.
E.g. an infrastructure team may define a service activity or flow "provision a cloud environment" and that activity may be referenced by services in application development flows.
