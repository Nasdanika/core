Start is an initial [pseudo-state](PseudoState.html) with only outputs and no inputs
indicating start of a [journey](Journey.html). 

It can be used in journeys with ``explicit-start`` [modifier](JourneyElement.html#EAttribute-modifiers) to explicitly specify the initial state in cases where it is not inferred correctly.
