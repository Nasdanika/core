Relationship between artifacts. 
Together with artifact nesting allows to define structure of composite artifacts.
For example, a web application may contain a load balancer, worker nodes, and a database server nested artifacts
with relationships from the load balancer to the worker nodes and from the worker nodes to the database server.
