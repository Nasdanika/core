    object-signing:
      name: Object signing
      description: |+2
        Similar to code signing - during the load process digests are computed for objects and stored in the object if it implements Signed interface.
        For nested objects signatures are used in computing the container signature for contained objects which implement Signed.
        Signing is performed if the loading context provides Signer service. Object signing can be used in combination with markers to track and prove
        data provenance. Possibly use JWT - build a JSON Object, sign, get the signature and store in the object.
        Perhaps sign the root object and just compute hashes of contained objects.
